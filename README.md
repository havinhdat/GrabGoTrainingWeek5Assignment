# GrabGoTrainingWeek5Assignment

1. Clone repository
2. Adjust the code using DI so that:
    - We can have API, business, rendering logic decoupled from each others.
    - Add tests for each component (Can use [https://github.com/vektra/mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to create mocks for interfaces).
    - Create XML rendering (instead of JSON) component, that we can easily plug in or out.
3. Submit a pull request.

TODO:

- [X] decouple API
- [X] decouple business
- [X] decouple rendering logic
- [X] Create XML rendering
- [] Add tests
- [] Remove explicit type casting on usecases (Go don't have generic)
- [] Clearly errors handling
